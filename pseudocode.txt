MAIN
  Process command line args
  Input validation
  Parse input to decide which mode and pattern did user choose (THREAD MODE vs PROCESS MODE)


PROCESS MODE
  PROCESS PATTERN 1 (1 parent with multiple children process)
    1st Loop until reach number that user input
        Create child process (fork())
    2nd Loop until reach number that user input
        Wait for all children process to finish
    End.

  PROCESS PATTERN 2 (Main process create children then children create their own children and so on)
    Create a parent process
    Call a function and pass the current process to check if there're any children left
    If there're stil children left
        Repeat the calling process and keep creating children of children until there're no children left
    If there're no children left
        Children terminates in a bottom up order
    Back to our original process and wait for it to exit
    End.

THREAD MODE
  THREAD PATTERN 1 
    Similar to PROCESS PATTERN 1 but use pthread_create() instead of fork(), and pthread_join() instead of wait(NULL)
  THREAD PATERN 2
   Create our main thread (pthread_create)
    Check if our main thread have any children left
      If there're still children
        Create children thread from current thread
      If there're no children left
        Join the thread one by one
    Back to our main thread and join our main thread
    End.
